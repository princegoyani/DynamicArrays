**Project Overview: Procedural Terrain Generation**

This program employs procedural generation to create 2D simulated landmasses. Customizable terrain features, including size, waterline, and various parameters, are facilitated. The output provides a character-based map representation, suitable for simulations or game development.

**Usage:**
1. **Compile:** Use a C compiler (e.g., gcc terrain_gen.c -o terrain_gen -lm).
2. **Run:** Execute with ./terrain_gen for random terrain or ./terrain_gen <seed> for a specific seed.
3. **Input Parameters:** Enter values for terrain dimensions and features as prompted.
4. **Output:** The terrain is displayed on the console and saved in text files (raw_landmass.txt, normalized_landmass.txt, final_landmass.txt).

**Topics:**
- Variables creation and usage
- printf and scanf for input/output
- Simple File I/O operations
- Control structures for logic flow
- Math and random number manipulation
- Dynamic allocation of multi-dimensional arrays
- Basic void and value-returning function creation

**Description:**
This assignment ensures comprehension of dynamic array allocation by using it for procedural landmass generation. The project showcases fundamental programming skills in C, encompassing input/output handling, control structures, file operations, and dynamic memory allocation. Ideal for educational purposes and as a foundation for more complex simulations or game development.
